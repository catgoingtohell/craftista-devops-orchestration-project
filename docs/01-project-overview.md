# 1. Project Overview

## Executive Summary

The Craftista DevOps Project demonstrates the implementation of a complete DevOps pipeline using modern tools and practices. This project showcases the integration of containerization, orchestration, infrastructure as code, continuous integration/deployment, and monitoring for a React-based web application.

## Project Objectives

- Implement a complete CI/CD pipeline from development to production
- Demonstrate Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices
- Showcase container orchestration using Kubernetes
- Implement GitOps methodology with ArgoCD
- Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Ensure security best practices throughout the pipeline

## Application Description

**Craftista** is a modern React-based web application built with:
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui library
- **State Management**: TanStack Query
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
